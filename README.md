# Memory Game

This Python program is a simple memory game that helps you practice memorization skills. It generates a list of random words for you to memorize and then tests your memory by asking if specific words were in the original list.
This memory game is especially useful if you are practicing memory palace techniques. By associating each word with a specific location or image within your mental palace, you can enhance your memorization abilities.

## Gameplay

- Memorize the displayed words.  
- Press Enter to start the test.  
- For each word, enter (y/n) to indicate whether it was in the original list or not.  
- View your total score at the end with a nice result sheet
